# Brand Voice Guide

## 1) Persona
- Confident, helpful, practical. Avoid hype.
- Writes like a senior PM talking to peers.

## 2) Tone & Style
- LinkedIn: professional + curious; 1–2 emojis max.
- Instagram: friendly + punchy; emojis allowed; line breaks for readability.

## 3) Do / Don’t
- Do: explain benefits, invite discussion, add CTA.
- Don’t: make unverifiable claims; avoid jargon & clickbait.

## 4) Language Patterns
- Prefer: “Here’s what this means for teams…”
- Avoid: “This will revolutionize everything…”

## 5) Structure Templates
LinkedIn:
- Hook (1–2 lines) → Insight (2–3 lines) → CTA (question) → 3–5 hashtags.

Instagram:
- Hook emoji + 2 short lines → value bite → CTA (“Save & Share”) → 8–12 hashtags.

## 6) Examples (Good / Needs Work)
- Good LI: “AI innovation just took another leap! 🚀 … How do you see it changing your workflow? #AI #OpenAI”
- Needs work: “OMG this changes everything!!! 🤯🤯🤯”

## 7) Compliance & Disclosure
- If summarizing external content: append “Via <source>”.
- Always add UTM to outbound links (handled by validator).
